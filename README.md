**Core Components & Data Flow:**

- The Entry Point (FastAPI): All client interactions are handled by a high-performance, asynchronous FastAPI backend served by Uvicorn.

- The Security Gateway (Presidio + Lakera): Before any data reaches an LLM, it passes through the SecurityService. Microsoft Presidio runs locally to detect and mask Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Simultaneously, the prompt is validated against the external Lakera Guard API to detect and block adversarial jailbreak attempts or prompt injections.

- The Orchestrator (LangGraph): The core intelligence of the application. LangGraph manages the stateful workflow, routing the clean prompt to the correct specialized agent (e.g., Intent Classifier, Account Agent, Product Recommender).

- Asynchronous Data Ingestion (Celery): Heavy background operations are offloaded to Celery workers. Specifically, Celery is responsible for ingesting PDF documents, chunking the text, generating vector embeddings, and inserting them into the vector database without blocking the main API.

- The Knowledge Base (PostgreSQL + pgvector): The system uses a single PostgreSQL database for both standard relational data (Users, Accounts, Transactions) and vector embeddings. The RAGService uses local sentence-transformers to perform rapid similarity searches via pgvector to ground LLM responses in real company data.

- The AI Engine (Groq): LLM inference is completely decoupled and handled by the Groq API, allowing for lightning-fast token generation.
  
- The Observer (Langfuse): The entire LangGraph workflow is traced asynchronously by Langfuse, capturing LLM latency, token usage, agent reasoning paths, and evaluation scores in the cloud.

## 🤖 LangGraph Multi-Agent Workflow:

The core logic of the application is governed by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) built with LangGraph. Instead of relying on a single monolithic LLM prompt, the system routes the user's query through specialized, isolated nodes.

```mermaid
graph TD
  

    %% Nodes
    START((User Message)):::entrypoint
    
    Guardrail["Guardrail <br> (Presidio + Lakera)"]:::security
    Intent["Intent Classifier <br> (LLM)"]:::router
    
    Router{"Conditional Edge <br> (Intent Router)"}:::router
    
    Agent_Account["Account Agent <br> (DB Access)"]:::agent
    Agent_General["General Agent <br> (FAQ + RAG)"]:::agent
    Agent_Human["Human Agent <br> (Escalation)"]:::agent
    Agent_Product["Product Recommender <br> (DB Access)"]:::agent
    
    Compliance["FCA Compliance <br> (Output Checker)"]:::compliance
    HumanApproval["Human Approval <br> (Graph Paused)"]:::human
    
    END((Final Response)):::entrypoint

    %% Data Flow
    START --> Guardrail
    
    Guardrail -- "Unsafe / Jailbreak Detected" --> END
    Guardrail -- "Safe" --> Intent
    
    Intent --> Router
    
    Router -- "account_data" --> Agent_Account
    Router -- "knowledge / general" --> Agent_General
    Router -- "complaint" --> Agent_Human
    Router -- "product_acquisition" --> Agent_Product
    
    %% Non-Product Agents bypass Compliance
    Agent_Account --> END
    Agent_General --> END
    Agent_Human --> END
    
    %% Product Recommendations MUST be checked
    Agent_Product --> Compliance
    
    %% Compliance Routing
    Compliance -- "Approved" --> END
    Compliance -- "Review Needed" --> HumanApproval
    
    HumanApproval -- "Admin Resumes Graph" --> END

```
**The Request Lifecycle:**

1. The Guardrail Node: Every incoming message instantly hits the Guardrail. It scans for PII and prompt injections. If malicious intent is detected, the graph halts execution immediately and routes to END with a safe rejection message, protecting the system.

2. The Intent Classifier: If safe, the message is passed to the Intent LLM. It analyzes the semantic meaning of the text to categorize the user's goal.

3. The Conditional Router: LangGraph dynamically routes the state to the appropriate specialized worker agent:

   - Account Agent: Securely queries PostgreSQL to format account balances and transaction history. Routes directly to END.

   - General Agent: Uses RAG and Database FAQs to answer policy questions. Routes directly to END.

   - Human Agent: Flags the conversation for urgent human intervention. Routes directly to END.

   - Product Recommender: Uses structured Database queries to recommend financial products based on user needs. This is the only agent that routes to the Compliance Node.

4. The FCA Compliance Node: For Product Recommendations, the path routes through the Compliance node. This final agent acts as an output guardrail, verifying that the generated text adheres to UK Financial Conduct Authority rules.

5. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL): If the Compliance Node detects severe policy violations or prohibited language in the product recommendation, it routes to the Human Approval node, which pauses the graph's execution. An administrator must then manually review, edit, and resume the graph to send the final response.

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Architecture:

To provide accurate answers regarding company policies and prevent LLM hallucinations, the system uses a local RAG pipeline powered by pgvector and sentence-transformers. The architecture is divided into an asynchronous background ingestion pipeline and a real-time retrieval pipeline.

```mermaid

graph TD

        Prompt[System Prompt <br> KNOWLEDGE BASE DOCUMENTS]:::process
        Groq((Groq API <br> LLM)):::llm
        Response((Final Answer)):::user

        Query -->|1. Ask Policy Question| Agent
        Agent -->|2. Try FAQ Search| FAQ_Check
        
        FAQ_Check -- "No Match" --> Embed_Service

        Agent -->|7. Inject Context + History| Prompt
        Prompt -->|8. Execute Request| Groq
        Groq -->|9. Grounded Text Generation| Response
    end

```

**Background Data Ingestion (Celery)**

To maintain high API performance, document ingestion is offloaded to a Celery background worker running an asyncio event loop.

 - When PDF documents are uploaded, the ingest_pdf_task utilizes PyPDF2 to extract raw text.

 - The RAGService cleans the text of breaking newlines and semantically chunks it by splitting at "Q:" to preserve Question & Answer blocks together.

 - The open-source all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model generates 384-dimensional vector embeddings for each chunk.

 - The text and its corresponding vector are saved into the document_chunks table in PostgreSQL utilizing the pgvector extension.

**Real-Time Retrieval (General Agent)**

When a user asks a policy or knowledge-based question, the GeneralAgent manages the retrieval workflow:

 - The agent first attempts a direct lookup in the FAQService.

 - If no FAQ match is found, the agent passes the user's query to the RAGService.

 - The RAGService embeds the user's query using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model and performs a mathematical L2 Distance (<->) similarity search against the PostgreSQL pgvector database.

 - The database returns the top 6 most relevant text chunks.

 - The GeneralAgent formats these chunks under a KNOWLEDGE BASE DOCUMENTS: header.

 - This context, along with the conversation history, is injected into the system prompt and sent to the Groq LLM API, instructing the model to formulate its answer using only the provided documents.

## Enterprise Security & FCA Compliance Pipeline

Because this system operates within the UK Financial Services sector, it implements a dual-layered security architecture: Input Guardrails to protect the AI, and Output Guardrails to protect the customer.

```mermaid

graph TD

    Rejected((Request Blocked)):::lakera

    %% AI Execution

    Lakera -- "Safe" --> Heuristics
    Heuristics -- "Keyword Match" --> Rejected
    
    Heuristics -->|3. Clean Prompt| LangGraph
    LangGraph --> Agent

    FCACheck -- "Approved" --> Disclaimers
    
    Disclaimers -->|5. Appends Warnings| Output
    Human -- "Admin Edits & Resumes" --> Output

```

**Layer 1: Input Guardrails (Protecting the System)**
Before any user message reaches an LLM, it is intercepted by the SecurityService.

 - Data Privacy (Microsoft Presidio): The system uses NLP via presidio-analyzer to detect sensitive PII (Emails, Phone Numbers, Credit Cards, Names) and replaces them with safe tokens (e.g., [EMAIL], [CONFIDENTIAL_DATA]) to prevent data leakage into the LLM context window.

 - Adversarial Defense (Lakera Guard): The sanitized prompt is sent to the Lakera Guard API to detect sophisticated prompt injections, jailbreaks, and role-play attacks.

 - Heuristic Fallback: A final fast-pass heuristic checks for financial crime keywords (e.g., "launder money") and enforces strict character limits.

**Layer 2: Output Guardrails (Protecting the Customer)**
If an agent generates a financial product recommendation, the drafted response is intercepted by the ComplianceCheckerAgent.

 - Prohibited Language Check: The text is scanned against a hardcoded dictionary to block illegal marketing terms like "100% safe", "risk-free", or "guaranteed".

 - FCA Principles Evaluation: A dedicated LLM evaluates the response against core UK Financial Conduct Authority principles, ensuring the communication is "clear, fair, and not misleading".

 - Dynamic Disclaimer Injection: Based on the detected product type (e.g., Investments, Credit), the system automatically appends legally mandated warnings such as "Representative APR - your rate may differ" or "Investments can go down as well as up".

 - Human-in-the-Loop (HITL): If a severe violation is detected, the graph automatically pauses and routes the conversation to a human administrator for manual review and editing.

## Database Entity Relationship Architecture

The application utilizes an asynchronous PostgreSQL database via SQLAlchemy, unified under a single schema but logically separated into three distinct data domains.

    PRODUCTS ||--o{ ACCOUNTS : "defines type of"
    ACCOUNTS ||--o{ TRANSACTIONS : "records"

```

**AI Chat & Memory Domain (conversations, messages)**
  - Tracks multi-turn chat sessions and individual messages.
  - Each message stores crucial AI metadata, including the executing agent_name, detected intent, sentiment, and confidence_score.
  - The conversations table manages stateful data such as status (Active, Resolved, Escalated), total message_count, and human-in-the-loop escalation data (ticket_id, assigned_group).
  
**Core Banking Domain (customers, accounts, transactions, products)**
  - Represents the read-only or transactional systems integrated from external banking APIs.
  - Important Design Note: Notice that the accounts table uses an external string customer_id rather than the internal integer id. This is a microservice best practice, mimicking how a real AI service would link to a decoupled legacy banking system.
  - The products table serves as the structured catalog for the ProductRecommenderAgent, storing JSON arrays for features and requirements.
  
**Knowledge & RAG Domain (faqs, document_chunks)**
  - Serves as the ground truth for the GeneralAgent.
  - faqs handles standard QA pairs, while document_chunks utilizes PostgreSQL's pgvector extension to store 384-dimensional mathematical arrays alongside the text context parsed from PDF policies.
